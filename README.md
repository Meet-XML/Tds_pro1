1.I used the GitHub API to collect data on users in Chennai, filtered by those who joined after 2020. For each user, I retrieved their repositories and programming languages. Then, I counted language occurrences to find popular ones


2.The most surprising finding was that many top developers in Chennai work independently, with diverse programming languages, reflecting a strong freelance and entrepreneurial community


3.Focus on mastering high-demand languages like Python and JavaScript; they dominate GitHub repositories and are essential skills for staying competitive in todayâ€™s job market.
